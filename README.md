#Combat Tracker

###TODO

- Extra data to items
    - "Don't show in CC"
    - "Auto Roll Attack"
    - etc
- Show if item has Uses
- Char Resources (Like Infuse Item, Tinkering etc)
- Death Saves
- Item info on name click like in character sheet.
- Conditions
###Bugs
- CombatTracker doesn't work (Onupdatecombat hook at least). Seems to be on Colorhammers side, because locally works.
